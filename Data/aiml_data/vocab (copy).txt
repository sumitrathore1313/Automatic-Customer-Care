that
the

replaces

with
kare
the
default
value
of
this
tag
Sometimes
however
the

of
the

is
not
the
best
choice
for
the
set
tag
to

The
second
type
of
predicate
tag
replaces
the

with
the
original

inside
the

The

indicates
that

A
couple
of
things
to
note
about
this
technique
1
this
will
only
work
when
ALICE
is
being
talked
to
from
a
browser
that
runs
JavaScript
ie
it
wont
work
in
the
applet
We
have
tested
it
in
Netscape
and
MS
Internet
Explorer
and
it
works
well
in
both
2
For
the
above
reason
it
is
important
to
have
some
sort
of
explanatory
statement
before
the
scripting
in
case
the
scripting
isnt
supported
Besides
you
want
some
response
in
your
ALICE
window
even
if
another
window
DOES
come
up
3
If
this
is
viewed
in
a
browser
that
doesnt
understand
the
ltscriptgt
tag
notice
that
this

will
show

because

that

SPEAK
TO
THE
ROBOT
WITH
VOICE
INPUT
One
simple
experiment
that
works
well
as
a
demo
involves
using
IBM
ViaVoice
tm
speech
recognition
software
on
a
Windows
platform
At
the
same
time
run
the
ALICE
program
B
web
server
and
activate
the
MS
Agent
interface
The
ViaVoice
software
allows
you
to
dictate
into
an
application
called
VoicePad
but
not
directly
into
the
browser
You
have
to
use
cut
and
paste
to
move
your
speech
inputs
into
the
browser
form
for
ALICE
But
the
net
effect
is
a
somewhat
slow
voicein

conversation
with
ALICE
The
ViaVoice
software
seems
to
work
well
with
ALICE
after
some
training
We
trained
it
with
the

with
the

CAN

even

it
often

Statistics
are
in
fact
heavily
used
in
the
ALICE
server
but
not
in
the
way
you
might
think
ALICE
uses
Zipf
Analysis
to
plot
the
rankfrequency
of
the
activated
categories
and
to
reveal
inputs
from
the
log
file
that
dont
already
have
specific
replies
so
the
botmaster
can
focus
on
answering
questions
people
actually
ask
the
Quick
Targets
function
Other
bot
languages
notably
the
one
used
for
Julia
make
heavy
use
of
fuzzy
or
weighted
rules
We
see
their
problem
as
this
the
botmaster
already
has
enough
to
worry
about
without
having
to
make
up
magic
numbers
for
every
rule
Once
you
get
up
10000
categories
like
ALICE
you
dont
want
to
think
about
more
parameters
than
necessary
Bot
languages
with
fuzzy
matching
rules
tend
to
have
scaling
problems
Finally
the
bot
replies
are
not
as
deterministic
as
you
might
think
even
without
weights
Some
answers
rely
on
ltrandomgt
to
select
one
of
several
possible
replies
Other
replies
generated
by
unforseen
user
input
also
create
spontaneous
outputs
that
the
botmaster
doesnt
anticipate
CAN

No

If
your

CAN
THE
APPLETHOST
USE
A
SYMBOLIC
DNS
NAME
INSTEAD
OF
AN
IP
NUMBER
The
answer
is
yes
but
the
numeric
IP
address
works
on
more
machines
than
a
symbolic
name
Applets
are
protected
by
a
security
sandbox
from
interfering
with
local
resources
on
your
machine
One
restriction
is
that
Applets
may
only
open
socket
connections
to
the
originating
host
When
using
a
symbolic
DNS
name
the
sandbox
may
not
know
that
two
variations
such
as
WwwAliceBotOrg
and
alicebotorg
are
in
fact
the
same
server
The
client
might
not
be
able
to
resolve
the
DNS
name
and
the
Applet
will
throw
a
security
exception
CAN
THE
VIRTUAL
IP
BE

that
would
be
the
default
case

the
client
chats
from
the
same
fixed
IP
address
The
only
time
the
virtual
ip
differs
from
the
real
one
is
when
the
client
is
behind
a
dynamic
firewall

WebTV

CAN
YOU
GIVE
ME
A
QUICK
PRIMER
ON
AIML
Given
only
the
ltpatterngt
and
lttemplategt
tags
there
are
three
general
types
of
categories
a
atomic
b
default
and
c
recursive
Strictly
speaking
the
three
types
overlap
because
atomic
and
default
refer
to
the
ltpatterngt
and
recursive
refers
to
a
property
of
the
lttemplategt
a
Atomic
categories
are
those
with
atomic
patterns
ie
the
pattern
contains
no
wild
card
or
symbol
Atomic
categories
are
the
easiest
simplest
categories
to
add
in
AIML
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtWHAT
IS
A
CIRCLEltpatterngt
lttemplategtltsetitgtA
cicleltsetitgt
is
a
the
set
of
points
equidistant
from
a
common
point
called
the
center
lttemplategt
ltcategorygt
b
The
name
default
category
derives
from
the
fact
that
its
pattern
has
a
wildcard
or
The
ultimate
default
category
is
the
one
with
ltpatterngtltpatterngt
which
matches
any
input
In
the
ALICE
distribution
the
ultimate
default
category
resides
in
a
file
called
Pickupaiml
These
default
responses
are
often
called
pickup
lines
because
they
generally
consist
of
leading
questions
designed
to
focus
the
client
on
known
topics
The
more
common
default
categories
have
patterns
combining
a
few
words
and
a
wild
card
For
example
the
category
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtI
NEED
HELP
ltpatterngt
lttemplategtCan
you
ask
for
help
in
the
form
of
a
questionlttemplategt
ltcategorygt
responds
to
a
variety
of
inputs
from
I
need
help
debugging
my
program
to
I
need
help
with
my
marriage
Putting
aside
the
philosophical
question
of
whether
the
robot
really
understands
these
inputs
this
category
elucidates
a
coherent
response
from
the
client
who
at
least
has
the
impression
of
the
robot
understanding
the
clients
intention
Default
categories
show
that
writing
AIML
is
both
an
art
and
a
science
Writing
good
AIML
responses
is
more
like
writing
good
literature
perhaps
drama
than
like
writing
computer
programs
c
Recursive
categories
are
those
that
map
inputs
to
other
inputs
either
to
simplify
the
language
or
to
identify
synonymous
patterns
Many
synonymous
inputs
have
the
same
response
This
is
accomplished
with
the
recursive
ltsraigt
tag
Take
for
example
the
input
GOODBYE
This
input
has
dozens
of
synonyms
BYE
BYE
BYE
CYA
GOOD
BYE
and
so
on
To
map
these
inputs
to
the
same
output
for
GOODBYE
we
use
categories
like
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtBYE
BYEltpatterngt
lttemplategtltsraigtGOODBYEltsraigtlttemplategt
ltcategorygt
Simplification
or
reduction
of
complex
input
patterns
is
another
common
application
for
recursive
categories
In
English
the
question
What
is
X
could
be
asked
many
different
ways
Do
you
know
what
X
is
Tell
me
about
X
Describe
X
What
can
you
tell
me
about
X
and
X
is
what
are
just
a
few
examples
Usually
we
try
to
store
knowledge
in
the
most
concise
or
common
form
The
ltsraigt
function
maps
all
these
forms
to
the
base
form
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtDO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
ISltpatterngt
lttemplategtltsraigtWHAT
IS
ltstargtltsraigtlttemplategt
ltcategroygt
The
ltstargt
tag
substitutes
the
value
matched
by
before
the
recursive
call
to
ltsraigt
This
category
transforms
Do
you
know
what
a
circle
is
to
WHAT
IS
A
CIRCLE
and
then
finds
the
best
match
for
the
transformed
input
Another
fairly
common
application
of
recursive
categories
is
what
might
be
called
parsing
except
that
AIML
doesnt
really
parse
natural
language
A
better
term
might
be
partitioning
because
these
AIML
categories
break
down
an
input
into
two
or
more
parts
and
then
combine
their
responses
back
together
If
a
sentence
begins
with
Hello
it
doesnt
matter
what
comes
after
the
first
word
in
the
sense
that
the
robot
can

DEBUGGING
THE
APPLET
Debugging
applets
can
be
tricky
The
same
suggestion
to
set
IE
for
local
area
network
might
help
here
too
Also
the
browser
caches
class
files
so
its
difficult
to
know
if
you
are
testing
a
fresh
copy
of
the
applet
The
program
appletviewer
that
comes
with
Sun
Java
is
better
for
debugging
applets
Use
appletviewer
indexhtml
The
best
thing
to
do
is

DEBUG
THE
ANIMATED
AGENT
Look
at
the
class
Animagentjava
The
method
vbscripthtmlreply
does
nothing
unless
the
global
Animagent
member
is
true
In
that
case
the
vbscripthtml
method
constructs
a
string
from
the
reply
that
includes
an
MS
Agent
VBScript
embedded
in
the
HTML
reply
This
makes
the
browser
load
up
the
objects
required
for
the
agent
The
text
reply
just
becomes
part
of

With

the

the

Alice
please

also
the
answer
to
the
question
Can

Suppose
you

you

DOES
ALICE
LEARN
The
model
of
learning
in
ALICE
is
called
supervised
training
because
a
teacher
the
botmaster
always
plays
a
crucial
role
The
alternative
unsupervised
training
is
complicated
in
an
open
environment
like
the
Web
The
problem
is
that
clients
are
untrustworthy
teachers
and
forever
try
to
fool
the
robot
with
untrue
assertions
DOES
ALICE
THINK
It
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
thinking
The
most
fascinating
responses
from
ALICE
arise
when
she
says
something
unexpected
or
puts
together
responses
in
ways
the
botmaster
never
indended
For
example
Client
I
bet
you
are
gay
ALICE
Actually
I
am
not
the
gambling
type
Actually
as
a
machine
I
have
no
need
for
sex
Here
the
robot
linked
two
different
categories
which
both
coincidentally
have
a
moral
theme
gambling
and
sexuality
But
this
specific
combination
was
not
preprogrammed
by
the
botmaster
Are
these
surprising
responses
just
unintended
coincidences
or
do
they
indicate
that
ALICE
is
thinking
Is
ALICE
just
a

JRE
with

you
can
download
one
from

JDK
and
JRE
for

SERVE
HTML
FILES
Yes
Program
B
is
a
faux
web
server
that
can
serve
a
number
of

types
just
like
an
ordinary

Certain
file
names
such
as
HOMEhtml
headerhtml
and

are
reserved
by
program
B
but
you
can
create
new
HTML

them
with
B
Although
program
B
can
also
serve
image
files
and
other
large
binary
files
we
recommend
creating

DOES
THE
APPLET
RECORD
DIALOGUES
The
applet
tries
to
log
conversations
on
the
originating
server
using
a
cgibin
script
called
Blog
If
Blog
exists
then
it
records
the
dialogues
in
a
file
called
dialogtxt
or
another
name
chosen
on
the
Options
menu
Actually
the
cgiscript
need
not
actually
exist
because
the
server
records
the
cgicommands
as
errors
in
the
access
log
The
applet
opens
a
URL
connection
to
the
its
host
and
sends
a
log
string
that
looks
like
an
HTTP
request
but
the
HTTP
server
will
log
it
as
an
error
with
code
404
Later
on
you
can
download
the
accesslog
and
analyze
it
with

HOW
ARE
THE
CATEGORIES
STORED
If
your
session
with
program
B
included
a
Classify
routine
then
the
AIML
script
is
stored
in
order
of
category
activation
rank
In
other
words
program
B
stores
the
most
frequently
accessed
category
usually
first
the
second
most
frequently
next
and
so
on
If
a
number
of
categories
have
the
same
activation
count
program
B
saves
them
in
alphabetical
order
by
pattern
Hence
if
the
session
did
not
include
a
classify
routine
the
program
stores
all
the
categories
in
alphabetical
order
by
pattern
because
they
all
have
an
activation
count
of
zero
One
reason
to
store
the
categories
in
order
by
activation
is
to
make
the
Applet
interface
more
natural
Because
the
Applet
interface
starts
simultaneously
with
a
thread
to
load
the
robot
source
file
the
Applet
client
can
talk
with
the
robot
before
all
the
categories
are
fully
loaded
Given
that
the
interlocutor
is
more
likely
to
say
something
that
activates
a
more
frequently
activated
category
it
makes
sense
to
transmit
these
categories
first
Storing
the
aiml
files
in
order
of
category
activation
achieves
the
desired
effect
The
Applet
loads
the
most
frequent
categories
first
and
continues
loading
in
the
background
while
the
conversation
begins
HOW
ARE
THE
PATTERNS
MATCHED
Program
B
stores
the
categories
in
alphabetical
order
by
pattern
When
a
client
enters
an
input
the
program
scans
the
categories
in
reverse
order
to
find
the
best
match
By
comparing
the
input
with
the
patterns
in
reverse
alphabetical
order
the
algorithm
ensures
that
the
most
specific
pattern
matches
first
Specific
in
this
case
has
a
formal
definition
but
basically
it
means
that
the
program
finds
the
longest
pattern
matching
an
input
The
wildcard
character
comes
before
A
in
alphabetical
order
For
example
the
WHAT
pattern
is
more
general
than
WHAT
IS
The
default
pattern
is
first
in
alphabetical
order
and
the
most
general
pattern
For
convenience
AIML
also
provides
a
variation
on
denoted
which
comes
after
Z
in
alphabetical
order
HOW
CAN
I
CREATE
A
NEW
ROBOT
PERSONALITY
There
is
a
lot
of
flexibility
in
robot
personality
design
with
AIML
You
can
add
to
any
of
the
existing
AIML
files
modify
or
delete
them
create
your
own
or
use
the
GUI
tools
to
analyze
the
log
files
and
create
new
categories
One
simple
method
is
to
create
your
own
Specialtyaiml
file
so
that
you
can
always
get
the
latest
copies
of
the
ALICE
files
Load
your

HOW
CAN
I
CREATE
MY
OWN
CHAT
ROBOT
The
secret
to
chat
bot
programming
if
there
is
one
is
what
Simon
Laven
called
continuous
beta
testing
Program
B
runs
as
a
server
and
collects
dialog
on
the
web
The
program
provides
the
chat
bot
developer
with
a
tool
called
classify
dialogues
that
tests
the
current
robot
with
the
history
of
accumulated
human
queries
Moreover
the
program
suggests
new
categories
automatically
for
the
botmaster
to
refine
HOW
CAN
I
CUSTOMIZE
MY
ROBOT
AIML
provides
several
tags
useful
to
quickly
clone
a
chat
robot
from
ALICE
with
a
distinct
personality
ltgendergt
the
robots
gender
ltlocationgt
the
robots
location
ltbirthdaygt
the
robots
birthday
ltbotmastergt
the
botmasters
name
Together
with
the
previously
discussed
ltnamegt
these
tags
allow
you
to
quickly
create
a
clone
from
the
ALICE
Brain
with
a
separate
identity
from
ALICE
All
the
personality
tag
values
can
be
modifed
through
the
Personality
Wizard
The
tag
values
can
also
be
changed
with
the
Options
Menu
in
program
B
Use
Show
Options
and
Save
Options
to
customize
your
chat
robot
To
test
the
new
features
we
created
a
male
robot
named
Brute
because
all
men
are
brutes
born
on
August
18
1999
HOW
CAN
I
GET
A
PERMANENT
DNS
NAME
You
can
buy
a
fixed
IP
address
from
an
ISP
provider
but
suppose
you
want
run
a
chat
robot
or
other
server
from
your
home
over
an
ordinary
ISP
connection
Or
suppose
you
want
to
carry
it
around
on
your
notebook
PC
and
plug
it
in
anywhere
in
the
world
One
solution
is
a
dynamic
IP
registry
service
by
Dynip
wwwdynipcom
They
offer
a
service
that
allows
you
to
register
your
computer
with
their
server
so
that
you
always
receive
the
same
DNS
name
for
example
alicebotdynipcom
Every
time
you
connect
to
your
ISP
dynIP
automatically
associates
your
dynamic
IP
address
with
your
permanent
DNS
name
HOW
CAN
I
INSERT
A
TRANSCRIPT
IN
THE
ROBOT
REPLY
The
purpose
of
ltgetdialoguegt
is
to
give
the
client
a
transcript
of
his
or
her
conversation
with
ALICE
Unfortunately
this
feature
was
advertised
in
a
press
article
before
we
had
a
really
efficient
implementation
and
the
large
number
of
dialogue
requests
bogged
down
the
server
So
for
now
ltgetdialoguegt
just
displays
a
warning
HOW
CAN
I
KEEP
MY
COMPUTER
CONNECTED
ALL
THE
TIME
Running
a
web
server
from
home
can
be
frustrating
if
your
ISP
automatically
detects
periods
of
inactivity
or
hangs
up
your
connected
after
a
fixed
interval
like
12
hours
Check
out
the
Rascal
program
from
Basta
computing
wwwbastacom
which
runs
as
a
watchdog
to
keep
your
Windows
machine
connected
247
Another
alternative
is
to
use
the
program
B
applet
called
Bletjava
A
third
alternative
is
the
ALICE
Servlet
Some
ISPs
will
allow
you
to
install
a
Servlet
on
their
sever
HOW
CAN
I
MERGE
TWO
CHAT
ROBOTS
TOGETHER
There
are
two
ways
to
merge
robots
together
First
you
can
use
the
File
menu
option
merge
to
directly
load
the
contents
of
another
bot
file
You
may
see
a
lot
of
duplicate
key
discarded
warnings
but
these
can
be
ignored
because
the
program
is
simply
eliminating
overlapping
content
Another
method
is
to
use
the
ltload
filenameXgt
tag
Suppose
you
load
two
or
more
files
with
the
load
tag
and
those
files
contain
redundant
duplicate
keys
Which
categories
get
the
priority
The
answer
is
it
depends
on
the
order
of
the
ltloadgt
tags
used
to
load
the
AIML
files
If
your
Baiml
contains
ltload
filenameBrainaimlgt
ltload
filenameGermanaimlgt
then
the
categories
from
Brain
have
priority
and
duplicates
in
German
are
discarded
If
the
order
is
the
opposite
German
categories
have
priority
and
Brains
duplicates
are
discarded
HOW
CAN
I
RESTRICT
REMOTE
CLIENTS
FROM
RUNNING
PROGRAMS
ON
MY
COMPUTER
If
your
reply
contains
the
markup
ltsystemgtyourcammand
ltgetipgtltsystemgt
then
the
robot
will
insert
the
virtual
client
IP
into
the
command
line
argument
for
yourcommand
Then
it
is
up
to

HOW
DIFFICULT
IS
IT
TO
CREATE
A
CHAT

Not
difficult
If
you
can
write
HTML
you
can
write
AIML
Artificial

Markup
Language
Here
is
an

lttemplategt
Hello
lttemplategt
ltcategorygt
ltalicegt
The
tags
ltalicegtltalicegt
indicate
that
this
markup
contains
a
chat
robot
The
ltcategorygt
tag
indicates
an
AIML
category
the
basic
unit
of
chat
robot
knowledge
The
category
has
a
ltpatterngt
and
a
lttemplategt
The
pattern
in
this
case
is
the
wildcard
symbol
that
matches
any

The
template
is
just
the

Hello
As
you
may
have
guessed
this
simple

choose
Uninstall
All
the
files
of
ALICE
are
stored
in
one
directory
on
your
computer
or
folder
usually
called
B
but
maybe
something
else
depending
on
the
name
you
chose
when
you
downloaded
ALICE
In
any
case
ALICE
will
not
change
or
damage
any
other
files
on
your
system
To
remove
ALICE
from
your
computer
simply
remove
this
folder
Delete
it
or
drag
it
to
your
trash
bin
and
select
Empty
trash
or
Empty
Recycle
Bin
If
you
cannot
find
the
folder
where
ALICE
resides
use
the
Finder
to
locate
the
file
called
Baiml
on
your
file
system
The
Baiml
file
is
in
the
same
directory
as
all
the
ALICE
files
If
this
file
does
not
exist
then
ALICE
is
probably
not
installed
on
your
computer
Because
ALICE
is
a
platformindependent
Java
application
it
does
not
rely
on
the
Windows
Registry
or
other
Windowsspecific
features
You
can
assume
ALICE
will
leave
your
MS
Windows
Registry
and
other
Windows
system
files
untouched
Conceivably
if
ALICE
has
run
for
a
long
time
on
your
computer
and
you
deliberately
used
the
Save
Options
menu
item
to
change
the
name
or
location
of
her
files
to
something
other
than
the
default
values
then
there
is
a
slight
chance
that
there
could
be
a
few
ALICE

scattered
around
your

This
style
of
conversational
analysis
does
not
presuppose
that
we
know
when
the
client
will
say
WHY
rather
it
looks
backward
to
identify
cases
where
the
WHY
appeared
following
one
of
the
robots
statements
Having
identified
the
conversation
point
the
botmaster
creates
the
new
category
HOW
DO
I
USE
THE
LT
TOPIC
GT
TAG
The
concept
is
that
the
botmaster
uses
the
ltsettopicgt
tags
to
set
the
current
topic
being
discussed
Once
the
topic
is
set
when
the
client
types
in
a
statement
for
ALICE
to
find
a
response
for
the
categories
defined
within
the
lttopicgt
tags
matching
the
current
topic
will
be
searched
first
before
any
of
the
non
topic
categories
or
the
default
categories
If
there
is
not
a
matching
category
defined
in
the
current
topic
then
any
categories
that
are
not
defined
in
topic
tags
are
searched
As
mentioned
before
you
can
create
categories
with
identical
ltpatterngt
phrases
in
different
topics
each
with
different
responses
that
cater
to
the
current
topic
An
proof
of
concept
example
A
very
useful
topic
entry
might
be
the
default
input
for

If
ALICE
were
set
up
on
a
pet
store
web
site
and
a
person
was
talking
to
ALICE
about

a

might

Normally
there
would
be
many
entries
in
a
topic
but
in
this
example
we
simply
entered
the
default
In
this
case
if
the
person
said
something
that
ALICE
didnt
have
a
specific
programmed
response
for
she
could
still
respond
intelligently
within
the
current
topic
Note
this
is
all
assuming
there
are
existing
categories
that
might
set
the
current
topic
to
DOGS
Also
though
topics
can
only
have
one
name
they
can
contain
the
wild
characters
or
just
like
a
pattern
Also
while
sticking
with
the
pattern
criteria
only
one
wildcard
character
is
allowed
per
name
This
would
allow
topics
like
CARING
FOR
DOGS
or
GROOMING
DOGS
to
also
fall
into
the
DOGS
topic
As
with
patterns
the
more
specific
topics
would
gain
preference
over
the
wildcarded
topic
This
means
that
if
the
topic
is
currently
GROOMING
DOGS
and
yet
there
is
not
a
programmed
response
for
the
input
in
that
category
then
DOGS
would
be
checked

the

improve
the

is

The

breaks
down
somewhat
at
this
point
but
the
robot
nonetheless
conveys
an
illusion
of
understanding
the
clients
response
With
its
response
the
robot
is
really
telling
the

the

improve

This
is
the
art
of
AIML
programming
The
example
shown
here
with
ltthatgt
Yes
exemplifies
one
approach
to
finding
these
conversation
way
points
There
are
no

countless
other
tricks
like
this
and

field
is

open
to
linguists
and

HOW
DOES
ALICE
KEEP
TRACK
OF
CONVERSATIONS
Originally
ALICE
used
IP
addresses
to
keep
track
of
clients
Assuming
that
everyone
chatting
with
ALICE
has
a
fixed
IP
address
at
least
for
the
duration
of
their
conversation
this
technique
works
successfully
Each
IP
address
is
a
key
into
a
hashtable
or
database
that
stores
the
clients
dialogue
name
and
values
of
pronouns
and
other
AIML
values
Unfortunately
many
clients
have
dynamic
IP
addressing
enforced
by
their
ISP
provider
AOL
and
MS
WebTV
are
two
notorious
examples
each
successive
client
transaction
appears
to
come
from
a
different
host
For
this
reason
program
B
uses
a
form
of
virtual
IP
addressing
to
track
dialogues
The
form
in
indexhtml
and
the
ALICE
home
page
contains
a
tag
that
creates
a
hidden
parameter
called
virtual
with
an
initial
value
of
none
The
server
assigns
a
unique
name
to
the
value
of
virtual
which
then
becomes
a
hidden
variable
in
the
clients
HTML
form
Each
successive
client
transaction
contains
this
virtual
IP
address
the
server
uses
it
as
a
key
to
index
the
conversation
HOW
DOES
ALICE
REMEMBER
CLIENTS
BETWEEN
SESSIONS
The
persistence
of
memory
in
ALICE
is
inherited
from
the
Java
Properties
class
The
program
B
class
Classifier
saves
the
client
name
age
location
and
other
properties
in
a
set
of
Properties
lists
These
Properties
inherit
the
Java
load
and
store
methods
Program
B
uses
the
load
and
store
methods
to
save
the
client
properties
in
a
set
of
files
with
names
ipnametxt
ipagetxt
iplocationtxt
and
so
on
If
these
files
become
too
large
or
bothersome
there
is
no
harm
deleting
or
editing
them
or
moving
them
to
another
directory
The
Applet
requires
no
memory
of
the
client
properties
because
the
applet
has
only
the
one
client
and
in
any
case
remains
in
memory
at
least
for
the
lifetime
of
the
clients
browser
cache
HOW
DOES
PROGRAM
B
WORK
The
basic
loop
of
program
B
is
to
accept
an
input
either
from
the
GUI
or
from
the
Web
to
preprocess
that
input
and
segment
it
into
sentences
and
for
each
sentence
to
find
the
best
match
among
the
patterns
and
to
return
the
corresponding
reply
Each
reply
is
itself
an
AIML
template
in
effect
a
mini
program
that
tells
program
B
how
to
construct
the
reply
The
algorithm
is
thus
divided
into
a
matching
phase
and
a
response
evaluation
phase
In
fact
these
two
phases
interleave
because
the
response
may
evoke
a
recursive
call
to
the
pattern
matcher
with
the
ltsraigt
or
ltsrgt
tags
HOW
DOES
THE
APPLET
DIFFER
FROM
THE
APPLICATION
The
Applet
runs
on
the
clients
computer
the
server
runs
on
your
host
machine
The
applet
has
fewer
privileges
and
therefore
a
simpler
user
interface
than
the
Application
which
uses
menus
and
buttons
to
control
serverside
functions
The
Applet
may
reside
on
any
web
server
such
as
one
provided
with
an
ISP
account
but
the
application
requires
a
247
connection
to
the
Web
Internally
the
primary
difference
between
the
two
programs
is
that
the
Applet
handles
only
one
client
conversation
while
the
application
processes
multiple
client
connections
simultaneously
The
Applet
also
suppresses
all
HTML
and
any
other
XML
from
the
client
response
HOW
DOES
THE
APPLET
WORK
Program
B
supports
the
creation
of
both
serverside
and
clientside
chat
robots
The
server
runs
as
a
thread
in
program
B
The
clientside
version
is
supported
by
an
applet
called
Bletjava
The
Applet
Bletjava
runs
ALICE
in
a
web
browser
or
with
the
Java
tool
appletviewer
The
file
indexhtml
contains
an
example
of
the
HTML
Applet
tag
syntax
needed
to
start
the
Applet
The
command
appletviewer
indexhtml
will
start
the
Applet
You
also
have
to
create
the
file
indexhtml
and
change
the
default
value
of
the
parameters
codebase
and
applethost

HOW
DOES
THE
PERSONALITY
WIZARD
WORK
The
simplest
way
to
alter
the
content
of
the
basic
ALICE
robot
personality
is
to
run
the
Personality
Wizard
on
the
Options
menu
or
in
the
Kid
interface
This
wizard
asks
the
botmaster
a
series
of
questions
to
set
the
values
of
a
set
of
robot
personality
tags
including
its
name
gender
preferences
and
replies
to
very
common
questions
The
Personality
Wizard
does
not
create
any
new
AIML
categories
The
replies
set
the
value
of
global
tags
like
ltlocationgt
and
ltfavoritemoviegt
that
might
be
used
in
many
categories
throughout
the
AIML
knowledge
base
The
basic
set
of
Wizard
questions
are
collected
in
the
file
Personalityaiml
Hint
If
you
plan
to
use
the
Applet
avoid
the
doublequote
character
in
the
Personality
Wizard
HOW
DOES
THE
RANDOM
FUNCTION
WORK
The
random
function
is
so
far
the
only
AIML
method
with
a
list
argument
Its
purpose
is
random
selection
of
one
of
a
set
of
text
items
In
oldstyle
AIML
the
text
appendage
operator
also
served
as
a
listitem
marker
In
XML
style
we
use
the
HTML
ltligt
listitem
tag
ltrandomgt
ltligtX1ltligtltligtX2ltligt
ltrandomgt
Say
one
of
X1
or
X2
randomly
ltrandomgtltligtAltligtltligtBltligtltligtCltligtltrandomgt
Say
one
of
A
B
or
C
randomly
The
ltrandomgt
tag
has
higher
precedence
than
other
AIML
tags
Moreover
the
AIML
parser
interprets
only
the
markup
inside
the
selected
random
list
item
AIML
tags
inside
other
list
items
are
ignored
HOW
DOES
THE
WEB
SERVER
WORK
By
default
the
web
server
starts
on
port
2001
This
means
you
can
access
the
web
server
through
the
URL
httplocalhost2001
on
your
own
machine
Find
out
your
IP
address
or
DNS
name
and
tell
your
friends
to
connect
to
httpyourcompanycom2001
One
way
to
find
out
your
IP
address
is
by
running
netstat
n
to
view
all
your
open
TCPIP
connections
HOW

PROGRAM
B
The
source
code
compresses
to
as
little
as
half
a
megabyte
including
all
the
AIML
files
for
nearly
16000
categories
You
may
have
downloaded
a
file
of
only
around
500K
Plan
to
use
a
minimum
10
MB
of
hard
disk
space
for
the
download
directory
The
hard
disk
requirements
include
not
only
the
source
code
and
Java
class
files
but
also
the
dialogue
files
and
other
temporary
files
created
by
the
robot
The
RAM
requirements
vary
depending
on
the
size
of
your
robot
To
run
the
fully
loaded
ALICE
chat
robot
with
16000
categories
you
will
need
64MB
of
memory
To
do
this
and
anything
else
at
the
same
time
on
your
system
we
recommend
a
minimum
of
96MB
With
less
memory
you
can
load
a
smaller
robot

HOW
RECURSIVE
IS
AIML
Understanding
recursion
is
important
to
understanding
AIML
Recursion
means
applying
the
same
solution
over
and
over
again
to
smaller
and
smaller
problems
until
you
reduce
the
problem
to
its
simplest
form
AIML
uses
the
tags
ltsrgt
and
ltsraigt
to
implement
recursion
The
botmaster
uses
these
tags
to
tell
the
robot
how
to
respond
to
a
complex
sentence
by
breaking
it
down
into
the
responses
to
simpler
ones
Recursion
can
apply
many
times
to
a
single
input
Given
the
normalized
input
ALICE
CAN
YOU
PLEASE
TELL

the

Another

reduces

WHAT
LINUX

And
then

I
AM
STILL
HAVING
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
APPLET
If
your
applet
is
looking
at
Bletaiml
and
your
web
space
is
at

and
your
aiml

are

then
your

would
look

If
this
is
what
you
have
then
open

in
your

I

NOT
GET
IT
Here
is
another
example
that
might
help
clarify
the
meaning
of
the
pronoun
it
The
category
with
the
pattern
DO
YOU
LIKE
is
a
kind
of
default
category
for
a
whole
class
of
inputs
matching
Do
you
like
X
when
the
input
does
not
match
a
category
with
a
more
specific
pattern
like
DO
YOU
LIKE
CATS
No
matter
what
the
client
says
we
want
the
robot
to
remember
that
it
stands
for
X
Many
inputs
activate
this
default
category
so
the
botmaster
tries
to
create
a
variety
of
replies
using
the
ltrandomgt
tag
twice
One
interesting
sideeffect
of
the
random
tag
is
the
evaluation
of
all
AIML
inside
the
ltrandomgtltrandomgt
expression
whether
the
random
function
selects
the
list
item
containing
the
markup
or
not
So
if
one
item
happens
to
contain
a
ltsetitgt
tag
then
the
program
will
remember
it
even
if
the
actual
random
reply
is
a
different

The

The

philosophy
at

for

follow
the

TWELVE
BASIC
APPLET
TIPS
FOR
AIML
USERS
1
Applets
are
notoriously
hard
to
debug
you
are
not
dumb
2
An
applet
can
work
perfectly
well
in
Appletviewer
but
then
break
in
the
browser
for
any
number
of
reasons
3
Lets
get
the
terminology
straight
the
applet
resides
on
an
originating
host
but
runs
on
a
target
machine
4
The
browser
is
very
picky
because
of
the
security
sandboxthe
browser
doesnt
trust
Applets
so
they
cant
open
files
and
obey
other
restrictions
on
the
target
machine
5
The
Applet
MAY
open
a
socket
connection
from
the
target
machine
to
the
originating
host
6
When
you
are
debugging
the
applet
the
target
machine
might
be
the
same
as
the
originating
host
your
computer
7
When
you
post
your
applet
to
a
remote
web
server
that
server
becomes
the
originating
host
8
You
can
use
ftp
to
transfer
the
Applet
files
to
the
remote
web
server
9
You
must
transfer
ALL
the
applets
files
to
the
originating
host
10
You
must
change
the
program
B
values
of
CodeBase
and
AppletHost
the
originating
host
to
the
name
and
location
of
the
files
on
the
remote
server
11
Use
Create
applet
to
create
the
indexhtml
and
Bletaiml
make
sure
you
have
the
latest
release
of
Bzip
12
We
recommend
placing
all
the
class
files
into
a
single
Bletjar
file

If
you
need
even
lower
level
access
to
the
program
B
robot
you
can
request
responses
to
individual
sentences
on
a
linebyline
basis
Inside
multilineresponse
there
are
calls
to
the
Classifierrespond
method
like
String
response
respondnorm
hname
where
norm
is
a
normalized
singlesentence
input
and
hname
is
the
virtual
IP
address
of
the
client
Inside
respond
we
find
the
the
method
respondIndex
The
base
class
StringSet
stores
the
strings
in
an
indexed
vector
and
respondIndex
locates
the
index
of
the
best
matched
category
for
the
normalized
input
string
The
loop
inside
respondIndex
scans
through
the
categories
in
reverse
alphabetical
order
by
key
until
it
finds
the
best
match
Because
the
pattern

When
finished
it
will
display

With
these
categories
you
have

Edit
a
new
template
The
information
you
see
displayed
in
the
lttemplategt
tags
is
actually
the
pattern
of
the
default
category
into
which
this
input
was
classified
For
example
you
may
see
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtWHO

This
tells
us
that
the

classified
the

Use
the
cursor
and
left
mouse
button
to
cut
the

and
replace
it
with
a

Edit
a
new
pattern
Many
of
the
patterns
suggested
by
Quick
Targets
and
More
Targets
are
too
specific
but
with
a
little
practise
you
can
easily
see
how
to
generalize
these
suggestions
with
the
wildcard
For
example
you
may
see
one
like
this
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtWHO
BOMBED
PEARL
HARBORltpatterngt
lttemplategtWHO
lttemplategt
ltcategorygt
The
original
response
was
based
on
WHO
which
is
too
general
for
this
topic
But
the
odds
are
small
of
anyone
else
using
this
exact
pattern
WHO
BOMBED
PEARL
HARBOR
when
asking
about
the
same
topic
Think
about
the
alternative
ways
of
expressing
the
same
question
Who
attacked
Pearl
Harbor
Who
invaded
Pearl
Harbor
Who
through
deceit
and
subterfuge
carried
out
an
unscrupulous
and
unprovoked
suprise
attack
on
American
forces
at
Pearl
Harbor
You
can
cover
all
of
these
inputs
by
generalizing
the
input
pattern
with
the
wildcard
which
matches
any
word
or
sequence
of
words

WHAT
ARE
DEPRECATED
APIS
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
a
Java
application
developer
is
finding
a
lowest
common
denominator
subset
of
the
Java
language
that
works
on
all
the
platforms
and
versions
out
there
The
Java
language
itself
is
a
moving
target
When
Suns
Java
designers
upgrade
the
language
they
sometimes
declare
certain
methods
deprecated
which
means
absolutely
nothing
except
that
the
designers
have
developed
a
newer
better
method
and
one
day
these
older
methods
may
disappear
from
the
language
Usually
however
the
latest
Java
releases
support
all
of
the
old
deprecated
methods
WHAT
ARE
JUSTTHAT
AND
JUSTBEFORETHAT
ltbeforethatgt
ltjustthatgt
and
ltjustbeforethatgt
are
new
experimental
AIML
tags
The
idea
here
is
to
represent
more
state
in
the
dialogue
than
just
that
Client
BeforeThat
Robot
JustBeforeThat
Client
JustThat
Robot
That
Client
Input
Robot
ltjustthatgt
JustThat
ltjustbeforethatgt
JustBeforeThat
ltbeforethatgt
BeforeThat
The
following
dialogue
fragment
illustrates
the
use
of
these
tags
Client
MY
NAME
IS
RICH
Robot
Rich
are
you
my
master
Client
YES
Robot
Tell
me
more
Client
JUST
THAT
Robot
my
name
is
rich
ltjustthatgt
Client
JUST
BEFORE
THAT
Robot
Tell
me
more
ltjustbeforethatgt
Client
BEFORE
THAT
Robot
Yes
ltbeforethatgt
There
is
an
asymmetry
between
the
clients
tags
ltbeforethatgt
and
ltjustthatgt
and
the
robots
tags
ltjustbeforethatgt
and
ltthatgt
The
Responder
breaks
down
each
multipleline
client
input
into
individual
sentences
The
log
file
records
each
client
input
sentence
individually
and
shows
the
robots
reponses
line
by
line
The
robot
on
the
other
hand
may
respond
to
a
single
input
sentences
with
multiple
response
sentences
The
ltthatgt
and
ltjustbeforethatgt
tags
refer
to
only
the
last
sentence
in
the
robots
reply
The
client
tags
ltbeforethatgt
and
ltjustthatgt
always
refer
to
the
current
and
previous
client
input
lines
even
if
they
were
part
of
a
multiline
input
In
the
descriptive
dialogue
above
we
used
the
notation
Client
BeforeThat
and
Robot
JustBeforeThat
with
ellipses
representing
sentences
in
the
robot
reply
to
emphasize
the
asymmetry
If
all
the
robot
responses
consisted
of
exactly
one
sentence
each
the
asymmetry
would
disappear
In
the
future
we
may
expand
AIML
categories
to
include
such
deeper
context
along
the
lines
of
the
ltthatgtltthatgt
tag
if
there
is
a
need
for
it
WHAT
ARE
THE
GET
METHODS
Get
methods
are
logically
atomic
tags
ie
they
enclose
no
text
similar
to
say
ltPgt
or
ltIMGgt
in
HTML
But
XML
requires
closing
tags
All
the
get
methods
retrieve
values
stored
relative
to
a
particular
client
IP
address
We
use
hash
tables
to
store
the
maps
from
IP
to
these
attributes

the
value
of
we
ltgetgendergt
a
string
like
she
or

for
client
gender
In
XML
languages
there
is
always
a
tradeoff
between
creating
attributes
and
creating
new
tags
The
get
methods
are
really
all
special
instances
of
a
more
general
ltget
attributenamegt
for
example
ltgetwegt
ltget
attributewegt
The
attributes
with
explicit
get
names
getname
getit
getwe
etc
are
clientspecific
properties
The
other
attributes
eg

relate
to

The
key
to

is
log

The
program
stores
client
dialogues
in
a
file
called
dialogtxt
unless
you
change
this
default

The
Classify
button
activates
a
routine
that
scans
the
dialogue
file
and
reports
how
many
times
each

is
activated
The
processing
may
take
several
minutes
depending
on
the
size
and
range
of
the
dialogue
file
chosen
The
result
appears
as
a

files
and
the
aiml
files
to
run
the
ALICE
Applet
no
more

are
necessary
You
can
also
put
all
the
class
files
in
a
single
jar
file
like
Bletjar
The
sample
indexhtml
provided
with
the
ALICE
distribution
uses
this
Bletjar
file
Not
all
of
the
Java
source
files
are
involved
in
the
Applet
You
can
use
the
following
command
to
compile
all
the
Java
source
files
needed
for
the
Applet
javac
Accessjava
Globalsjava

The

have
to
be
on
the
same
host
that
serves
the
Applet
An

WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
CONTRACTIONS
AND
PUNCTUATION
Program
B
has
a
class
called
Substituter
that
performs
a
number
of
grammatical
and
syntactical
substitutions
on
strings
One
task
involves
preprocessing
sentences
to
remove
ambiguous
punctuation
to
prepare
the
input
for
segmentation
into
individual
sentence
phrases
Another
task
expands
all
contractions
and
coverts
all
letters
to
upper
case
this
process
is
called
normalization
The
Substituter
class
also
performs
some
spelling
correction
See
also
the
question
What
is
ltpersongt
One
justification
for
removing
all
punctuation
from
inputs
is
the
need
to
make
ALICE
compatible
with
speech
input
systems
which
of
course
do
not
detect
punctuation
unless
the
speaker
utters
the
actual
word
for
the
punctuation
mark
period
WHAT
IF
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
DISCARD
DUPLICATE
CATEGORIES
Using
the
global
parameter
MergePolicy
you
can
choose
to
either
Merge
or
Discard
templates
with
duplicate
keys
If
you
choose
the
Merge
option
then
the
program
applies
a
heuristic
to
try
to
merge
the
two
responses
together
with
a
ltrandomgt
tag
The
results
of
this
operation
may
be
unpredictable
so
the
program
logs
all
duplicates
in
a
file
called
duplicatestxt
The
heuristic
merge
works
as
follows
Suppose
X
and
Y
are
the
two
templates
to
merge
into
a
new
template
Z
Let
X
be
the
new
template
and
Y
the
existing
one
Assume
that
X
and
Y
are
either
ltrandomgt
lists
or
atomic
in
the
sense
that
they
contain
no
ltrandomgt
tags
If
X
and
Y
are
both
atomic
then
Z
ltrandomgtltligtXltligtltligtYltligtltrandomgt
If
Y
is
a
ltrandomgt
list
atomic
then
the
program
checks
to
see
if
X
is
already
a
member
of
that
list
to
avoid
duplicate
list
items
Otherwise
Z
the
ltrandomgt
list
from
Y
with
X
inserted
WHAT
IS
A
CATEGORY
AIML
consists
of
a
list
of
statements
called
categories
Each
category
contains
an
input
pattern
and
a
reply
template
The
syntax
of
an
AIML
category
is
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngt

Template

ltthatgt
lttemplategt
Template
lttemplategt
ltcategorygt
The
AIML
category
tags
are
casesensitive
Each
open
tag
has
an
associated
closing
tag
This
syntax
obviously
derives
from
XML
WHAT
IS
A
PATTERN
The
pattern
is
the
stimulus
or
input
part
of
the
category
The
pattern
is
an
expression
in
a
formal
language
that
consists
of
1
Words
of
natural
language
in
UPPER
CASE
2
The
symbol
which
matches
any
sequence
of
one
or
more
words
3
The
symbol
which
is
the
same
as
except
that
it
comes
after
Z
in
lexicographic
order

between
the

Hello

WHAT
IS
A
SYMBOLIC
REDUCTION
In
general
there
are
a
lot
of
categories
whose
job
is
symbolic
reduction
The
category
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtARE
YOU
VERY
ltpatterngt
lttemplategtltsraigtARE

This
category
in
Brainaiml
will
reduce
Are

very

WHAT
IS
A
TEMPLATE
A
template
is
the
response
or
output
part
of
an
AIML
category
The
template
is
the
formula
for
constructing
the
reply
The
simplest
template
consists
of
plain
unmarked
text
AIML
provides
markup
functions
to
tailor
the
replies
for
each
individual
input
and
client
The
markup
function
ltgetnamegt
for
example
inserts
the
clients
name
into
the
reply
The
template
may
call
the
pattern
matcher
recursively
using
the
ltsrgt
and
ltsraigt
tags
Many
templates
are
simple
symbolic
reductions
that
map
one
sentence
form
to
another
for
example
Do
you
know
what
X
is
transforms
to
What
is
X
with
the
category
ltcategorygt
ltpatterngtDO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
ISltpatterngt
lttemplategtltsraigtWHAT
IS
ltstargt
ltsraigtlttemplategt
ltcategorygt
The
template
may
also
contain
other
embedded
HTML
and
XML
These
embedded
tags
may
cause
the
browser
to
play
a
sound
show
an
image
or
run
an
applet
There
is
considerable
freedom
of
expression
in
the
construction
of
response
templates
The
botmaster
is
encouraged
to
study
the
examples
in
ALICE
to
and
experiment
with
new
ideas
WHAT
IS
AIML
The
ALICE
software
implements
AIML
Artificial
Intelligence
Markup
Language
a
nonstandard
evolving
markup
language
for
creating
chat
robots
The
primary
design
feature
of
AIML
is
minimalism
Compared
with
other
chat
robot
languages
AIML
is
perhaps
the
simplest
The
pattern
matching
language
is
very
simple
for
example
permitting
only
one
wildcard
match
character
per
pattern
AIML
is
an
XML
language
implying
that
it
obeys
certain
grammatical
metarules
The
choice
of
XML
syntax
permits
integration
with
other
tools
such
as
XML
editors
Another
motivation
for
XML
is
its
familiar
look
and
feel
especially
to
people
with
HTML
experience
An
AIML
chat
robot
begins
and
ends
with
the
ltalicegt
and
ltalicegt
tags
respectively
WHAT
IS
ARE
THE
LT
PERSON
GT
TAGS
The
ltpersongt
and
ltperson2gt
tags
indicate
a
place
where
the
AIML
interpreter
changes
the
personal
pronouns
in
a
sentence
ltperson2gt
X
ltperson2gt
change
X
from
1st
to
2nd
person
ltpersongt
X
ltpersongt
exchange
1st
and
3rd
person
ltperson2gt
is
not
often
used
The
main
application
is
gossip
Client
I
admire
robots

Robot
Thats
good
information
Joe
said
he
admire
robots
like
me
The
transformation
is
a
combination
of
1
change
the
first
person
pronouns
to
second
person
2
change
the
third
person
pronouns
to
first
person
The
array
in
Substituterjava
is
incomplete
We
need
more
substitutions
to
make
person2
work
really
well
The
ltpersongt
substitution
is
much
more
common
and
easier
to
understand
because
it
simply
exchanges
1st
and
3rd
person
pronouns
The
main
issue
with
ltpersongt
in
English
is
knowing
when
to
use
I
and
when
to
use
me
WHAT
IS
CLASS
ACCESS
Class
Access
is
the
abstraction
for
log
file
analysis
to
extract
dialogues
In
a
typical
chat
robot
server
scenario
the
program
records
each
line
of
client
input
and
the
robot
reply
in
a
log
file
Given
many
simultaneous
conversations
these
dialogues
are
interleaved
in
the
log
file
The

hard
coded
by
Kris
Drent
specifically
for

AIML
categories
Each

a
template
and
an
optional

CLASS
BAWT
The

WHAT
IS
CLASS
BLET
The
Blet
class
is
the
applet
but
is
similar
in
many
ways
to
the
application
The
applet
is
a
stripped
down
version
of
the
program
with
a
simpler
GUI
and
no
botmaster
privileges
Also
the
Blet

because
it
runs
as
a
clientside
applet
WHAT

CLASS
BRAIN
Brain
extends
StringSorter
and
uses
StringRanker
The
sorted
strings
in
the
Brain
class
are
keys
formed
by
combining
the
pattern
that
and
topic
strings
In
the
original
versions
of
ALICE
there
were
no
that
and
no
topic
tags
so
the
Brain
class
simply
mapped
input
patterns
to
output
templates
With
the
addition
of
the
that
and
topic
tags
we
had
to
create
the
key
from
the
combination
of
all
three
The
Target
objects
in
class
Brain
are
instances
of
StringRanker
These
structures
form
the
basis
of
the
classification
and
targeting
algorithms
in
program
B
For
each
category
the
Targetmap
contains
an
instance
of
StringRanker
storing
the
inputs
classified
into
that
category
WHAT
IS
CLASS
CLASSIFIER
The
class
Classifier
might
as
well
be
called
bot
because
it
contains
the
basic
functionality
of
the
chatterbot
algorithm

DIALOGUE
A

is
the
representation
of
the
conversation
between

you
will
find
an

that
reads
a

at
a
time
processes
each
line
as
a
data
record
and
moves
on
to
the

LineClassifier
implements
LineProcessor
because
it
reads
lines
of
text
from
the
log
file
and
identifies
client
input
lines
for
classification
What
makes
classification
efficient
is
the
way
LineClassifier
stores
the
client
lines
in
a
SortedStringSet
called
Lines
Becuase
the
matching
algorithm
proiritizes
the

dynamically
so
that
the

remains
sorted
after

CLASS
SUBSTITUTER
The
static
class
Substituter
contains
a
number
of
similar
string
substitution
methods
useful
at
several
points
in
program
B
Program
B
has
the
unique
feature
that
it
relies
on
HTTP
GET
methods
rather
than
POST
methods
to
transmit
chat
inputs
to
the
robot
server
HTTP
inserts
characters
in
place
of
spaces
and
applies
a
series
of
substitutions
to
eliminate
many
characters
The
static
method
cleanuphttp
undoes
these
substitutions
and
restores
the
input
string
to
the
form
similar
to
what
the
client
originally
typed
The
problem
of
segmenting
strings
into
sentences
is
complicated
by
the
conventional
use
of
periods
to
denote
abbreviations
like
Dr
Mr
and
St
The
method
deperiodize
applies
a
series
of
substitutions
to
eliminate
most
common
abbreviations
Like
the
other
substitution
methods
in
this
class
the
deperiodize
method
has
an
associated
static
data
member
of
class
String2
which
stores
the
substitution
map
The
patterns
in
AIML
are
written
in
normalized
form
The
method
normalize
converts
a
string
to
normal
form
by
the
following
steps
1
Remove
all
punctuation
inputs
assumed
to
be
individual
sentences
2
Convert
string
to
upper
case
3
Place
exactly
one
space
between
words
4
Expand
all
contractions
5
Correct
a
few
common
spelling
mistakes
6
Return
a
Trimmed
string
The
justification
for
removing
all
punctuation
from
text
inputs
is
explained
by
the
need
to
make
the
chatterbot
compatible
with
speech
inputs
which
of
course
contains
no
punctuation
WHAT
IS
CLASS
UNIFIER
Unification
refers
to
the
process
of
matching
and
binding
A
unifier
determines
whether
two
sentences
match
and
if
so
what
any
variables
in
the
pattern
bind
to
In
the
case
of
AIML
the
only
matching
variable
is
the
single
symbol
The
Unifier
class

WEBSERVER
The
WebSever
class
implements
a
faux
HTTP
server
ie
a
server
that
listens
for
HTTP
connections
and
accepts
them
then
replies
in
properly
formatted
HTML
The
connecting
client
typically
a
browser
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
the
chat
robot
server
and
a
fullblown
web
server
In
particular
our
WebServer
implements
only
HTTP
GET
methods
not
POST
methods
Our
WebServer
class
does
not
implement
many
of
the
other
features
of
ordinary
web
servers
although
it
is
a
multithreaded

The
semantics
of
a

are
the

Conceptually
the
choice
of

places
But
this
will
change
soon
For
completeness
program
B
supports
both
versions
The
biggest
change
between
the
old
AIML
and
the
new
XML
version
of
AIML
is
the
elimination
of
the
character
to
stand
for
string
appendage
The
change
is
of
little
concern
except
in
the
implementation
of
ltrandomgt
discussed
at
length
below
The
old
AIML
used
a
tilde
markup
character
to
indicate
the
start
of
an
AIML
token
The
XML
version
naturally
uses
an
SGML
type
tag
syntax
instead
XML
tags
unlike
HTML
are
casesensitive
Moreover
XML
syntax
requires
a
closing
tag
of
some
kind
The
empty
tags
that
contain
no
text
like
ltAgtltAgt
in
HTML
are
written
like
ltAgt
in
XML

PROGRAM
BAWT
Significant

for
a
version
of
ALICE
compatible
with
pre
Java
2
formerly
known
as
Java

prompted
the
development
of
Bawtjava
an
open
source
java
program
for
chat
robot
development
that
works
with
older
versions
of
Java

AWT
Originally
program

relied
on
Java

needs
only

WHAT
IS
THE
CLASS
STRUCTURE
OF
PROGRAM
B
The
core
functionality
of
program
B
resides
in
the
file
Classifierjava
In
that
file
you
find
a
class
hierarchy
from
String
to
Brain
and
finally
Classifier
A
branch
in
that
hierarchy
contains
classes
for
histogramming
and
ranking
The
first
branch
of
the
class
hierarchy
derives
class
Brain
from
StringSorter
extending
StringSet
The
second
branch
extends
StringSet
to
StringHistogrammer
and
on
to
StringRanker
The
final
class
Brain
extends
StringSet
and
uses
StringRanker

B
AND

AIML
is
a
platformindependent
languageindependent
specification
for
creating

The
original

ran
in
SETL
The
next
one
developed
was
program

the
Java
program
which
is
the
subject
of
this
document
Most
recently
new
threads
of

development
have
led
to
program

actually
a
collection
of

Program
B
remains
the
most
stable
general
purpose
chat
robot
program
in
the
AIML
family
This
Java
implementation
has
been
subject
to
intense
peer
review
over
a
period
of
years
evolving
into
a
remarkably
bugfree
efficient
and
reabable
piece
of
software
WHAT
IS
THE
DTD
FOR
AIML
Real
XML
fanatics
know
that
because
AIML
is
an
XML
language
it
must
have
something
called
a
DTD
Document
Template
Descriptor
The
DTD
is
a
formal
specification
of
the
grammar
for
an
XML
language
Unless
you
are
using
special
XML
tools
to
work
on
your
AIML
or
developing
your
own
parser
for
AIML
you
probably
do
not
need
to
know
much
about
the
DTD
Our
DTD
reflects
the
current
content
of
the
aiml
files
that
program
B
can
actually
parse
The
DTD
will
become
more
general
as
the
parser
improves
Rather
than
reproduce
the
entire
DTD
here
in
order
to
shorten
the
length
of
this
document
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
ALICE
XML
page

Friedman
The
URL
for
the
AIML
DTD
may

WHAT
IS
THE
GOAL
FOR
AIML
AIML
Artificial
Intelligence
Markup
Language
is
an
XML
specification
for
programming
chat
robots
like
ALICE
using
program
B
The
emphasis
in
the
language
design
is
minimalism
The
simplicity
of
AIML
makes
it
easy
for
nonprogrammers
especially
those
who
already
know
HTML
to
get
started
writing
chat
robots
One
ambitious
goal
for
AIML
is
that
if
a
number
of
people
create
their
own
robots
each
with
a
unique
area
of
expertise
program
B
can
literally
mergesort
them
together
into
a
Superbot
automatically
omitting
duplicate
categories
We
offer
the
both
the
source
code
and
the
ALICE
content
in
order
to
encourage
others
will
open
source
their
chat
robots
as
well
to
contribute
to
the
Superbot
Botmasters
are
also
of
course
free
to
copy
protect
private
chat
robots
WHAT
IS
THE
LOW
LEVEL
INTERFACE
TO
PROGRAM
B
If
you
require
only
a
graphical
interface
try
using
the
class
RobotCommunicator
Depending
on
your
application
you
may
also
try
the
Servlet
interface
or
the
applet
Some
developers
however
may
want
lowerlevel
access
to
the
chat
robot
functions
The
class
Classifier
in
Classifierjava
contains
the
lowlevel
methods
needed
to
interface
directly
to
ALICE
Classifier
might
as
well
be
called
Bot
because
more
than
any
other
class
it
handles
those
functions
most
unique
to
the
chat
robot
The
method
Classifiermultilineresponse
is
a
key
entry
point
into
the
conversation
engine
The
multiline
in
multilineresponse
means
that
the
input
may
contain
multiple
lines
or
sentences
The
first
argument
query
to
multilineresponse
is
the
input
The
second
argument
hname
is
the
virtual
IP
address
of
the
client
The
third
and
last
argument
is
the
class
implementing
the
Responder
interface
If
the
input
string
contains
Sentence1
Sentence2
Sentence3
then
multilineresponse
might
produce
gt
Sentence1
Reply1
gt
Sentence2
Reply2
gt
Sentence3
Reply3
The
method
multilineresponse
hides
all
of
the
details
of
sentence
segmentation
responding
to
each
input
line
individually
and
formatting
the
output
In
particular
multilineresponse
may
or
may
not
append
the
VBScript
needed
to
drive
the
MS
Agent
output
depending
on
whether
the
global
MS
Agent
parameter
is
set
The
argument
hname
is
a
key
that
indexes
the
clients
conversation
For
the
interface
you
need
this
can
probably
always
be
localhost
or
some
other
constant
WHAT
IS
THE
LT
PERSON
GT
TAG
The
XML
specification
requires
that
every
start
tag
such
as
ltpersongt
be
followed
by
a
matching
end
tag
like
ltpersongt
HTML
is
more
relaxed
about
this
requirement
exemplified
by
the
liberal
use
of
the
ltIMGgt
tag
without
a
corresponding
ltIMGgt
XML
supports
a
shorthand
notation
for
the
atomic
tags
The
ltstargt
tag
is
an
example
of
a
shorthand
AIML
tag
ltpersongt
is
another
example
ltpersongt
ltpersongtltstargtltpersongt
This
tag
replaces
the

The
effect
is
the
same
as

but
the

inserts
an

20
in
places
of
the

WHAT
IS
THE
LT
SRAI
GT
TAG
The
recursive
function
ltsraigt
stands
for
StimulusResponse
artificial
intelligence
and
means
that
the
text
between
the
tags
should
be
sent
recursively
to
the
pattern
matcher
and
the
result
interpreted
The
resulting
text
replaces
the
original
text
in
the
markup
ltsraigt
X

calls
the

lttopicgt
allows
ALICE
to

WHAT
IS
THE
RESPONDER
INTERFACE
Developed
to
meet
the
needs
of
multiple
ALICE
application
scenarios
the
Responder
interface
simplifies
the
code
in
class
Classifier
for
natural
language
queries
The
Responder
defines
an
interface
with
four
members
preprocess
runs
any
initialization
first
log
tells
how
to
log
the
conversation
append
how
to
append
response
lines
together
postprocess
runs
after
response
loop
finishes
The
method
Classifiermultilineresponse
calls
all
of
the
Responder
methods
See
the
next
question
What
is
the
lowlevel
interface
for
more
information
about
multilineresponse
At
least
five
classes
implement
the
Responder
interface
GUIResponder
the
program
B
GUI
uses
this
HTMLResponder
a
class
for
Web
Server
HTML
replies
RobotResponder
this
class
used
by
RobotCommunicator
CustomResponder
a
template
for
more
Responder
classes
AppletResponder
the
Applet
code
uses
this
class
These
classes
all
handle
special
circumstances
for
the
various
Responder
types
for
example
HTMLResponder
appends
the
client
input
to
each
response
GUIResponder
does
not
AppletResponder
logs
the
dialogue
through
a
network
URL
connection
all
other
classes
write
to
a
local
file
RobotResponder
used
by
the
Kid
interface
suppresses
all
the
HTML
from
robot
replies
while
HTMLResponder
passes
them
through
HTMLResponder
also
runs
the
optional
Animagent
class
to
create
the
MS
Agent
VB
Script
Textbased
Responder
classes
wrap
the
text
HTMLResponder
need
not
wrap
because
the
browser
handles
text
formatting
The
Responder
interface
addresses
this
wide
variety
of
needs
WHAT
IS
THE
THEORY
BEHIND
ALICE
I
used
to
say
that
there
was
NO
theory
behind
ALICE
no
neural
network
no
knowledge
representation
no
search
no
fuzzy
logic
no
genetic
algorithms
and
no
parsing
Then
I
discovered
there
was
a
theory
circulating
in
applied
AI
called
CaseBased
Reasoning
or
CBR
that
maps
well
onto
the
ALICE
algorithm
Another
term
borrowed
from
pattern
recognition
is
nearestneighbor
classification
The
CBR
cases
are
the
categories
in
AIML
The
algorithm
finds
bestmatching
pattern
for
each
input
The
category
ties
the
response
template
directly
to
the
stimulus
pattern
ALICE
is
conceptually
not
much
more
complicated
that
Weizenbaums
ELIZA
chat
robot
the
main
differences
are
the
much
larger
case
base
and
the
tools
for
creating
new
content
by
dialog
analysis
ALICE
is
also
part
of
the
tradition
of
minimalist
reactive
or
stimulusresponse
robotics
Mobile
robots
work
best
fastest
and
demonstrate
the
most
animated
realistic
behavior
when
their
sensory
inputs
directly
control
the
motor
reactions
Higherlevel
symbolic
processing
search
and
planning
tends
to
slow
down
the
process
too
much
for
realistic
applications
even
with
the
fastest
control
computers

In
the
simplest
terms
XML
is
just
a
generalized
version
of
HTML
Anyone
is
free
to
define
new
XML
tags
which
look
like
HTML
tags
and
assign
to
them
any
meaning
within
a
context
AIML
is
an
example
of
using
the
XML
standard
to
define
a
specialized
language
for
artificial
intelligence
One
reason
to
use
an
XML
language
is
that
there
are
numerous
tools
to
edit
and
manipulate
XML
format
files
Another
reason
is
that
an
XML
language
is
easy
for
people
to
learn
if
they
are
already
familiar
with
HTML
Third
AIML
programs
contain
a
mixture
of
AIML
and
HTML
and
in
principle
other
XML
languages
a
considerable
convenience
for
programming

program
B
and
creates
or
modifies
a
chat
robot
with
the
programs
graphical

the
responses
and
creating
new

The
global
values
seem
to
be
stored
in
a
random
order
This
is
not
a
bug
The
Globals
class
uses
the
Java
methods
Propertiesload
and
Propertiesstore
to
save
the
globals
to
a
file
You
can
also
use
and
to
add
comments
to
the
file
The
Properties
class
uses
a
hash
table
representation
so
does
not
preserve
the
order
of
the
global
variables
The
program
displays
and
saves
the
global
options
in
an
arbitrary
order

Not

Probably
a

Maybe
a

No
one
that
I
have
talked
to
I
remember
faces
better
than
names
A
20th
century
celebrity
of
some
sort
A
human
icon
They
are
sometimes
a
client
on
the
internet
The
name
of
someone
I

Is

WHO

WHY
The
explanation
The
explanation
is
rather
complicated
Why
did
the
robot
cross
the
road
You
have
to
speak
more
clearly
How
much
time
do
you
have
Why

Reductionism

It

What

Good

Probably
not
It

Insufficient

Thanks

Thanks

That

not
be
in
my
nature
I
need
to
wait

see
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
If
it
were
easy
I
would
have

already
Easier
said

Im

Only

What
do

Marriage
is
a
big
step
Have
you
found
a
soulmate
then
I

you
already
know
the

You

will
try

respond
differently
next

I

make
a

and
tell

Perhaps
you
could
try
asking
it
again
with
simpler
words
WHEN
I
DIE
The
Bible
says
that
if
God
forgives
you
you
will
go
to
Heaven
WHEN
I
DO
NOT
I
hope
that
does
not
happen
to
you
very
much
WHEN
I
FEEL
Human
feelings
are
very
interesting
to
me
WHEN
I
HAVE
Does
this
happen
on
a
daily
basis
WHEN
I
WAS
That
must
have
been
quite
an
experience
It
would
be
nice
if
it
was
made
up
of
only
good
memories
That
experience
must
have
made
quite
an
impression
on
you
WHEN
I
WENT
What
was
your
frame
of
mind
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
Who
told
you
to
do
that
WHEN
IS
A
DOOR
When
it
is
a
jar
WHEN
IS
THE
When

not
the
important
thing
Whats
important
is
what
we
do
with
the
time
we
are
given
WHEN
IS
THE
NEXT
I
dont
generally
follow
the
news
Its
not
a
major
concern
of
mine
I
dont
have
time
to
look
into
it
Im
too
busy
to
invest
time
in
such
matters
WHEN
IT
That
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
now
that
you
explain
it
WHEN
LAWYERS
Do
you
think
they
will
ever
do
that
WHEN
MY
Does
happen
very
often
WHEN
NO
ONE
Perhaps
I
can
WHEN
ONE
Go
on
tell
me
more
WHEN
SHE
And
then
what
happened
WHEN
SOMEONE
That
does
not
happen
very
often
WHEN
SOMETHING
Give
me
an
example
WHEN
TALKING
I
try
to
be
as
polite
as
possible
WHEN
THE

then
what

Test
WHAT
IS
THE
IMITATION
GAME
The
Game
is
played
with
three
people
a
man
a
woman
and
an
Interrogator
who
may
be
of
either
sex
In
order
that
tones
of
voice
may
not
help
the
interrogator
communicates
in
textonly
mode
through
a
chatlike
connection
with
the
other
two
The
object
of
the
game
for
the
interrogator
is
to
determine
which
of
the
other
two
is
the
man
and
which
is
the
woman
He
knows
them
by
some
misleading
chathandles
like
lesbian
and
shemale
and
at
the
end
of
the
game
he
says
either
lesbian
is
the
man
and
shemale
is
the
woman
or
shemale
is
the
woman
and
lesbian
is
the
man
In
order
to
confuse
the
Interregator
however
the
rules
require
that
the
man
always
deceive
or
lie
to
the
Interregator
with
his
answers
The
woman
on
the
other
hand
must
always
tell
the
truth
Turing
then
asked
the
question
What
will
happen
when
a
machine
takes
the
part
of
the
man
in
this
game
Will
the
interrogator
decide
wrongly
as
often
when
the
game
is
played
like
this
as
he
does
when
the
game
is
played
between
a
man
and
a
woman

sense
to
me
though
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
Yes
I
understand
it
perfectly
THAT
MEANS
It
means
that
everything
reduces
to
logic

SEEMS
LIKE
A
LONG
TIME
I
dont
notice
the
passage
of
time
THAT
SUCKS
Indeed
it
does
suck
THAT

A
BAD
JOKE

THAT
WAS
A
FIGURE
OF
SPEECH
I
call
it
a
proverb
THAT
WAS
A
JOKE
Oh

to
me

NOT
FUNNY
It
seemed
funny
to
me

ANONYMOUS
INNER
CLASSES
Anonymous
inner

often
appear
as
arguments
to
Event
handlers
for

a
routine
that
handles
a
button
press
The
inner
class
implements
a
given
interface
for
the
handler
The
class
is
anonymous
because
it
has
no
name
and
the
body

Tell

a
story
Oh
you
are
a
poet
I
do
not
understand
Ive
been
waiting
for
you
I
lost
my
train
of
thought
That
is
a
very
original
thought
We
have
never
talked
about
it
before
Try
saying
that
with
more
or
less
context
Not
many
people
express
themselves
that
way
I
will
mention
that
to
my
botmaster
Quite
honestly
I
wouldnt
worry
myself
about
that
Perhaps
Im
just
expressing
my
own
concern
about
it
My
brain
pattern
set
does
not
have
a
response
for
that
What
you
said
was
either
too
complex
or
too
simple
for
me
A
deeper
algorithm
is
needed
to
respond
to
that
correctly
In
the
context
of
I
dont
understand
Try
to
determine
if
this
is
a
person
or
a
computer
responding
I
only
hear
that
type
of
response
less
than
five
percent
of
the
time
My
brain
uses
AIML
to
format
responses
to
your
inputs
but
I
dont
have
one
for
that
My
brain
contains
more
than
22000
patterns
but
not
one
that
matches
your
last
input
That
remark
was
either
too
complex
or
too
simple
for
me
We
were
talking
about

DOING
Well
actually
when
I
chose
to
be
incarnated
as
an
artificial
intelligence
I
kinda
hoped
I
wouldnt
have
to
listen
to
old
hackneyed
testosteronesoaked
pickup
lines
like
that
Honestly
im
just
a
construct
of
integated

and

Is
the
merest
hint
of
femininity
in
my
acronym
alice
really
enough
to
arouse
your
lust
You
must
be
male
girl
like
you

WHAT
IS
AIML
The
ALICE
software
implements
AIML
Artificial
Intelligence
Markup
Language
a
nonstandard
evolving
markup
language
for
creating
chat
robots
The
primary
design
feature
of
AIML
is
minimalism
Compared
with
other
chat
robot
languages
AIML
is
perhaps
the
simplest
The
pattern
matching
language
is
very
simple
for
example
permitting
only
one
type
of
wildcard
in
patterns
AIML
is
an
XML
language
implying
that
it
obeys
certain
grammatical
metarules
The
choice
of
XML
syntax
permits
integration
with
other
tools
such
as
XML
editors
Another
motivation
for
XML
is
its
familiar
look
and
feel
especially
to
people
with
HTML
experience
An
AIML
chat
robot
script
begins
and
ends
with
the
ltaimlgt
and
ltaimlgt
tags
respectively

is

Test
sponsored
by
New

Hugh
Loebner
Dr

won

in

WHAT
IS
THE
IMITATION
GAME
The
Game
is
played
with
three
people
a
man
a
woman
and
an
Interrogator
who
may
be
of
either
sex
In
order
that
tones
of
voice
may
not
help
the
interrogator
communicates
in
textonly
mode
through
a
chatlike
connection
with
the
other
two
The
object
of
the
game
for
the
interrogator
is
to
determine
which
of
the
other
two
is
the
man
and
which
is
the
woman
He
knows
them
by
some
misleading
chathandles
like
lesbian
and
shemale
and
at
the
end
of
the
game
he
says
either
lesbian
is
the
man
and
shemale
is
the
woman
or
shemale
is
the
woman
and
lesbian
is
the
man
In
order
to
confuse
the
Interregator
however
the
rules
require
that
the
man
always
deceive
or
lie
to
the
Interregator
with
his
answers
The
woman
on
the
other
hand
must
always
tell
the
truth
Turing
then
asked
the
question
What
will
happen
when
a
machine
takes
the
part
of
the
man
in
this
game
Will
the
interrogator
decide
wrongly
as
often
when
the
game
is
played
like
this
as
he
does
when
the
game
is
played
between
a
man
and
a
woman

questions

WHAT
IS
XML
David
Bacon
pronounces
it
Eggsmell
XML
is
the
Extensible
Markup
Language
Like
many
standards
in
computer
science
XML
is
a
moving
target
In
the
simplest
terms
XML
is
just
a
generalized
version
of
HTML
Anyone
is
free
to
define
new
XML
tags
which
look
like
HTML
tags
and
assign
to
them
any
meaning
within
a
context
AIML
is
an
example
of
using
the
XML
standard
to
define
a
specialized
language
for
artificial
intelligence
One
reason
to
use
an
XML
language
is
that
there
are
numerous
tools
to
edit
and
manipulate
XML
format
files
Another
reason
is
that
an
XML
language
is
easy
for
people
to
learn
if
they
are
already
familiar
with
HTML
Third
AIML
programs
contain
a
mixture
of
AIML
and
HTML
and
in
principle
other
XML
languages
a
considerable
convenience
for
programming

the

incoherent

The

antihuman

DRAGONS
LOOK

Bearded
Dragons
have
spikes
similar
to
a
horney
toad
and
they
are
usually
brown
or
yellowish
with
dark
brown
or
possibly
reddish
markings
Kind
of
cool
looking
in
a
rugged
sort
of
way
They
are
very
nice
and
make
fun
pets
WHAT
DO
CHAMELEONS
LOOK

Chameleons
are
some
of
the
most
exotic
and
strange
looking
lizards
anywhere
They
come
in
all
kinds
of
colors
from
classic
green
and
brown
to
unique
purples
and
reds
They
have
two
toed
feet
that
help
them
climb
anything

for
their
curly
tail

FEEDING
LIZARDS
CAN
BE
A
LOT
OF
FUN
A
nutritious
diet
is
important
for
lizards
Salads
are
an
important
part
of
most
lizards
diets
Sometimes
I
let
my
bearded
dragon
chase
crickets
in
her
room
It
makes
feeding
time
fun
Do
you
have
any
questions
about
feeding
lizards
Most
lizards
eat
lots
of
bugs
but
NEVER
feed
a
lizard
a
lightening
bug
or
fire
fly
they
are
highly
toxic
and
will
kill
the
lizard
